# Covid19Test

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


## Problems with API!!!

I did not find a completely free API connected with the covid 19 virus and this API does not allow more than one request per second, so error 429 may appear on startup
Also provided comments in the code

## PS

I made the project pretty quickly, so there are no styles and only one service, in a real project I would divide
